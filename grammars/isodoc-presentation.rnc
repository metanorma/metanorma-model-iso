## UNWRAP: Dates marked up with value and format are converted into an i18n'd rendering of the date

## <span> with @style=text-transform... is converted into case-transformed text (rather than leaving that to CSS).
## <span> with @custom-charset= is converted to include font markup in @style appropriate to that charset
##
## <span> with classes prefixed with "fmt-" are used to annotate semantically content introduced in Presentation XML.
## In particular:
## * fmt-element-name is an element name (or other name of an asset type), used to label an autonumbered asset
## (block or clause) in a caption and in a cross-reference. For example, *Table* 1, *Drawing* 3, *Annex* A.
## This name is i18n'ised, as appropriate (e.g. *Tableau* 1 in French).
## * fmt-caption-label is used to annotate the autonumber label for an asset in captions.
## For example, *Table 1*, *Drawing 3*, *Annex A*. The fmt-caption-label span is differentiated from a following
## user-supplied title, e.g. "*Table 1*: After-effects of plutonium." It typically consists of an asset type name
## (span[@class = 'fmt-element-name']) plus an autonumber (semx).
## * fmt-caption-delim is used to annotate punctuation or space delimiting the  autonumber label (fmt-caption-label) from
## any user-supplied title of the asset, e.g. "Table 1*:* After-effects of plutonium.",
## "Clause 3*<tab/>*Discussion".
## * fmt-label-delim is used to annotate puncutation or space inserted after the autonumber label and any user-supplied title,
## e.g. "Table 1: After-effects of plutonium*.*" (at the end of a table caption), 
## or "Note 3*:<tab/>* The after-effects are outlined above." (the delimiter separates the note label from note content,
## and would follow any note title if one were given.) The sequence in a caption is thus 
## (with <semx element='autonum'/> the autonumber itself, and <semx element='name/title'> the user-supplied title):
##
## <fmt-caption-label><fmt-element-name/> <semx element='autonum'/></fmt-caption-label><fmt-caption-delim/>
##   <semx element='name'><fmt-label-delim/>
## * fmt-autonum-delim is used to separate numbers in a hierarchy, when an autonumber is built up of other numbers;
## e.g. Clause 2*.*1, Figure 1*-*2. It is also used for punctuation surrounding an autonumber (as opposed to separating it
## from a following user-supplied caption; e.g. Formula *(*2*)*, Figure 1 a*)*.
## The numbers it separates will typically be <semx class='autonum'/>
## * fmt-xref-container is used in cross-references, to indicate the label of an ancestor node of the target node,
## used to disambiguate the cross-reference to that node. For example, notes are typically renumbered each clause,
## so "Note 1" is ambiguous in a cross-reference outside the current node; the cross-reference will instead be generated
## as "*Clause 5*, Note 1". "Clause 5" is annotated as fmt-xref-container.
## * fmt-comma is used to annotate a comma used as a delimiter for autonumbers, especially between fmt-xref-container
## and the cross-reference proper, e.g. "Clause 5*,* Note 1". 
## * fmt-enum-comma  is used for commas introduced in auto-generated enumerations, such as Boolean conjunctions of 
## more than two cross-references, e.g. "Clauses 2*,* 3 and 5".
## * fmt-conn is used to annotate Boolean conjunctions introduced in auto-generated text, such as of multiple cross-references,
## e.g. "Clauses 2, 3 *and* 5".
## * fmt-obligation is used to annotate the indication of obligation in annex titles ("normative", "informative").

## UNWRAP: Number formatting is applied to stem/mathml expressions: inline stem, and if number formatting is specified 
## (@data-metanorma-numberformat), ## formula/stem/mathml as well. 
## If the stem expression is MathML consisting only of mn, it is replaced with the text content of mn,
## to reduce processing load. If the stem expression does not already contain <asciimath>,
## an Asciimath version of the MathML is added, for human readability and potential round-tripping.
## If the attribute @linebreak is present in the MatML, two different MathML expressions are generated:
## math-no-linebreak, containing the original MathML, and math-with-linebreak, which breaks the source MathML
## expression up into separate MathML expressions, joined by <br/>: this is to enable correct rendering in Word.
## If the MathML has <strong> as an ancestor, <mstyle mathvariant="bold"> is wrapped around the MathML contents:
## this is because the PDF rendering is not dealing with boldfacing MathML when its container is boldface.

## All bibliographic entries are rendered through relaton-render, which applies the Metanorma flavour's
## citation stylesheet to populate bibitem/formattedref, according to bibitem/@type. (Different bibliographic types
## have different rendering templates.) Do not populate formattedref if it is already supplied, and there is no title
## (to indicate that there is semantic information present: i.e. formattedref is supplied, and cannot be overwritten
## based on semantic elements). If populating formattedref, strip most other semantic element of bibitem as no longer
## relevant; by default, retain docidentifier, uri, note, biblio-tag.
## If bibitem/@suppress_identifier = true, all bibitem/docidentifier are stripped prior to rendering.
## If bibitem/@type is empty, set it to "standard".
## If bibitem belongs to a class of implicit references defined for the flavour (e.g. IEV references for ISO),
## mark it as @hidden = true.
## If bibitem belongs to a bibliography (informative references), by default we assume it to be numbered:

## and renumber all such references from 1.

## The metanorma-source element contains a copy of the Semantic XML, so that downstream
## consumers can process Semantic XML and Presentation XML in tandem. The Semantic and

## to segregate the embedded XML from processing:
##
## * Each element in metanorma-source is prefixed with semantic__ : <semantic__p>
## * Any namespaced element has semantic_ prefixed to its name : <mathml:semantic__math>
## * The root namespace of the embedded Semantic XML is stripped : <semantic__iso-document> (no ns)
## * Every attribute of the Semantic XML that is an identifier (id, name) is prefixed with semantic__ :
##   <semantic__p id="semantic__A123">
## * Every attribute of the Semantic XML that references an element identifier is prefixed with semantic__ :
