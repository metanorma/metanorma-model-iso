= Grammars for IsoDoc documents

This directory contains RelaxNG Compact and RelaxNG grammars for:

* the base Metanorma Standard Document model (`isodoc*`),
* Various Metanorma gramars
* Various Relaton gramars

RelaxNG Compact is the source specification for grammars; RelaxNG is generated
from the RelaxNG Compact source, and is used by the Ruby gems validating
specifications against the models:

* https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso
* https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-cc
* https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-gb
* And so on

RelaxNG schemas are generated from the RelaxNG Compact schemas, using the `jing-trang`
gem. (The RelaxNG schemas are how documents are actually validated in the gems
generating Metanorma XML.)

The grammars are generated using `make.sh`. The grammars are validated using `bundle exec ruby test.rb`.
